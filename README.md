-The stained objects found in the marked images are 
labelled in set1, set2.txt. Marking is done as follows:

	1. file=7b_057. type=18 [44,269] [50,267] [54,274] 
	2. file=7b_057. type=18 [65,457] [75,454] [84,458] 
	3. file=7b_057. type=18 [257,463] [265,465] [272,464] 
	4. file=7b_057. type=4 [267,248] [293,254] [317,249] 
	5. file=7b_057. type=19 [459,349] [475,359] [497,359] 
	6. file=7b_057. type=18 [503,446] [508,451] [515,452] 
	7. file=7b_057. type=18 [571,255] [578,251] [584,257] 

-For example here, file name starting with 7b_057 have 7 stained objects 
(Detected automatically) 
-These 7 stained objects "types" were marked manually, to label their type and 3 coordinates (x,y)
locating them. type key is follows:
	
	type = 
	1...4  P.Vivax (ring, troph, schiz, gametocyte)
	5...8  P.Ovale (ring, troph, schiz, gametocyte)
	9...12 P.Falciparum (ring, troph, schiz, gametocyte)
	13...16 P.Malariae (ring, troph, schiz, gametocyte)
	17...20 Non-Parasites (white blood cell, platelet, artefact, incomplete object)


- Most of the images that are included in these sets were collected by me from real blood smears.  
- The stained objects in these images were marked by me and may contain errors.
